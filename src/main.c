 * This is a 3D FDTD code for simulating electromagnetic waves in cold 
 * magnetized plasmas.
 *
 * NOTE: This is an early version, including some obsolete function, those
 *       will be removed in near future.
 *       Furthermore, everything will be properly split into separate 
 *       libraries, allowing the usage of a nice make file.

 * Initial release on github: 2022-03-31
